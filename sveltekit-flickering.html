      <h2>Fixing My “Flickering” Issue With SvelteKit Server-Side Rendering</h2>

        <p>
          Since using SvelteKit, I have noticed an peculiar issue when loading
          data to a page. It is somewhat difficult for me to describe so I will
          link an
          <a href="https://test-sveltekit-double-loading.vercel.app/original"
            >example</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you load this page, you should see a number between 0 and 99
          which is quickly replaced by another such number. It might be really
          quick. Refreshing while disabling your browser cache might make it
          more pronounced. I&rsquo;ve long wondered why such behavior existed,
          but I recently asked on the r/sveltejs subreddit and received two
          relevant suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first was to load the data from
          <code>+page.server.js</code> instead of <code>+page.js</code>. Because
          <code>+page.js</code> is executed on the server and the client while
          <code>+page.server.js</code> is only run on the server. Meaning the
          value that I was seeing at first was from the server and then the
          second value was from re-running <code>+page.js</code> on the client.
          This approach worked in this example, you can see it at
          <a
            href="https://test-sveltekit-double-loading.vercel.app/using-page-server-js"
            >here</a
          >
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          However, on another project that already used
          <code>+page.server.js</code> to load its data was still experiencing
          this issue. Another commenter explained that this was the result of
          server-side rendering. Which makes sense. I don&rsquo;t REALLY
          understand server-side rendering, but my basic understanding is that
          the server starts and then hands the website off to the client to
          handle the rest. For this other project I went to the
          <code>+page.js</code> of the relevant route and added
          <code>export const ssr = false;</code> . This resolved the flickering
          issue.
        </p>
        <p>I have a feeling that this solution is bad practice and a hack.</p>
        <p>
          A commenter suggested that I don&rsquo;t need to set SSR to false and
          instead can just use <code>+page.server.js</code> &ldquo;and the SSR
          will take care of itself&rdquo;.
        </p>
        <p>
          By using <code>console.log</code> I have noticed differences between
          these 3 approaches. In the original approach it logs both the log from
          the <code>+page.js</code> and the <code>+page.svelte</code> on the
          server and in the browser (client). Only the numbers that are longed
          are different.

        <p>
          By renaming <code>+page.js</code> to <code>+page.server.js</code> the
          output on the server is the same but on the client it only logs from
          <code>+page.svelte</code> .

            </figure>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Lastly,
          <a
            href="https://test-sveltekit-double-loading.vercel.app/disabling-ssr"
            >when I disable SSR</a
          >
          in <code>+page.js</code> I get no logs on the server and get both
          lines on the client. I think this illustrates how SSR works. Without
          SSR, the client is responsible to run all scripts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, server-side rendering is something I should understand more
          if I want to master web development.
