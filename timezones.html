                <span class="c0">Let&rsquo;s examine why the idea of having a single time zone used
            globally bothers people. The first objection is that it feels weird
            to wake up at 3 pm and work from 5 pm to 1 am. The obvious response
            to this objection is to point out that we are already applying an
            arbitrary number of times of the day. There is nothing special about
            waking up at 7 am. And working from 9 am to 5 pm. These are simply
            numbers that we have collectively settled upon.</span

        <p class="c1 c4">
          <span class="c0"
            >Another common concern is how to know if someone in another time
            zone is awake/available. People expressing this concern exclaim that
            it&rsquo;d be too difficult to coordinate cross-time zones because
            you can&rsquo;t easily get a sense of what time of day it is there.
            Let&rsquo;s think about what we currently do to address this issue.
            If you&rsquo;re trying to communicate with someone in Japan you will
            look up the time in Japan on a mobile application or website. In a
            post-time zone world, the difference in the clock time is no longer
            existent. However, it introduces a new difference: solar time. Thus,
            instead of looking up the clock time in Japan, you&rsquo;d look up
            the time of sunset, noon, or any other well-known solar event. Then
            you can understand when this person is likely to be available
            without needing to convert back into your time.</span

        <p class="c1 c4">
          <span class="c0"
            >Many people wonder why we&rsquo;d want to change a system that
            isn&rsquo;t broken. My response to this is a bit more philosophical.
            Humanity&rsquo;s relationship with time has progressed steadily away
            from solar time and towards an arbitrary clock time.
            Humanity&rsquo;s first known acknowledgment of timekeeping came in
            the form of Obelisks dated to 3500 BCE in Egypt, Babylon, and China.
            Interpreting the time from Obelisks purely represented the solar
            time. By 1283, the first weight-powered clock was established in a
            monastery in England. This clock was quite precise, too precise.
            While the clock treated each day as 24 hours, each solar day is not
            24 hours. There are slight variations due to the elliptical nature
            of Earth&rsquo;s orbit around the Sun and the axial tilt of the
            Earth. To solve this, timekeepers frequently adjusted their clocks
            because solar time was still considered the &ldquo;real time&rdquo;.
            It&rsquo;s important to realize that the 24 hours that we call a day
            is not some truth of the universe. It is purely a human construction
            to cope with the irregularities of what we call a day by averaging
            the length of all days.</span

        <p class="c1 c4">
          <span class="c0"
            >Eventually, humans decided that if we are going to abstract away
            the solar time then we need to standardize for the sake of
            coordination. This change was driven by trains: a technology that
            demanded less local forms of coordination. The popularization of
            locomotives meant the first time in history that humans needed to
            know the time somewhere they weren&rsquo;t. We could no longer rely
            on local interpretations of time because this could lead to
            dangerous scenarios and make the coordination efforts of travelers
            challenging.</span

            >Looking at the modern world it is obvious that modern technology
            has reshaped the world far more than the popularization of
            locomotives did. Unfortunately, our timezones reflect more about
            politics than the position of the Sun. The easiest and most elegant
            solution is to abandon timezones.</span

            >&rsquo;s definition stating that the Metaverse is the time when
            people care more about their digital lives than their physical
            lives. If this world is coming (for some it is already here) what
            time will it be in the metaverse? There is no Sun so clinging on to
            a timezone system would be truly embarrassing. Just as it seemed
            ridiculous to a 13th-century monastery to use the clock time over
            the solar time, it is ridiculous to drag our centuries-old
            perceptions of time into the modern era.</span
